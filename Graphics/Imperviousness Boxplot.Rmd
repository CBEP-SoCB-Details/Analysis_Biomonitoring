# Introduction
Maine DEP has developed a robust stream classification model that is based on
collecting stream invertebrates from "rock baskets" left in streams for about
a month. They have also developed methods to assess water quality based on 
comments of the algae community.

In this Notebook, we focus on generating a plot that emphasizes the connection
between water quality and landuse.

Our principal data is a letter grade ('A', 'B', 'C', 'NA') assigned to each site
based on biomonitoring data. Our data on imperviousness is based only on 
LOCAL imperviousness (in the local catchment) not on total upstream IC.
 
# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(emmeans)
library(mblm)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder References
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

DEP uses "NA" to indicate "Non Attainment" in the data.  By default, R
interprets that as `NA`, meaning  missing data.  We need to address that in our
code for reading the data.  WE also need to be careful in later analyses that
R does not drop that value.  We considered changing the data label, but DEP
uses "NA" consistently, and for simplicity of communications it is easiest if we
retain the original designation.

**Note that this data contains invertebrate, wetland, and algae sample data,
including sometimes sharing the same site designations.**

## Read the Data
### Recent Sample Data
```{r load_sample_data}
fn <- "Recent_Stream_Biomonitoring.csv"
the_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn), na = '') %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, format = '%m/%d/%Y'),
         Year = as.integer(format(Date, format = '%Y'))) %>%
  relocate(Year, .after = Date) %>%
  relocate(Attained, .after = Final) %>%
  mutate(Final_o = ordered(Final, levels = c('NA', 'C', 'B', 'A'))) %>%
  mutate(Final_f = factor(Final, levels = c('I', 'NA', 'C', 'B', 'A'))) %>%
  relocate(c(Final_f, Final_o), .after = Final)
```
## Preliminary Plots
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
plt <- ggplot(the_data, aes(x = Final_f, y = local_imperv * 100)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab('Local  Imperviousness\n(Percent)') +
  xlab('Attained Class')
plt
```

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
plt + 
  geom_dotplot(binaxis='y', stackdir='center', binwidth = 1,
               stackratio=1, dotsize=1.5)

```

The following is better, addressing heteroskedasctiicty, but it may be hard to
explain to readers.
```{r}
plt + 
stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=18,
                 size=3, color="red") +
  scale_y_log10()
```

```{r}
n_fun <- function(x){
  return(data.frame(y = 55, label = paste0("n = ",length(x))))
}
plt +
  stat_summary(fun.data = n_fun, geom = "text")
```



# Make Table
```{r}
the_data %>%
  group_by(Final_f) %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(local_imperv * 100) ,
            med = median(local_imperv * 100),
            sample = n(),
            stdev = sd(local_imperv * 100) ,
            stderr = stdev/sqrt(sample),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,1,1,1,3,3),
               col.names = c('Achieved Class', 'Mean',
                             'Median' , 'Sample', 'Std Dev', 'Std Err'),
               caption = 'Imperviousness by Observed Class' )
```


# Direct Modelling
A log transform addresses heteroskedasticity, and improves the model.
```{r}
the_lm <- lm(log(local_imperv) ~ Final_f, data = the_data)
plot(the_lm)
```
```{r}
anova(the_lm)
summary(the_lm)
```
So, both 'NA' and 'A' are different from the reference level (here, 'I').
Without turning to EMMEANS or another pairwise procedure, we can not determine
other comparisons.


```{r}
(emm <- emmeans(the_lm, 'Final_f', type = 'response'))
```

```{r}
pwpp(emm)
```


So, pairwise comparisons A, B, and I show distributions of IC different from NA.
A is NEARLY different from I, B, and C.
