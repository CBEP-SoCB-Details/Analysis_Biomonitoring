This repository continues analysis begun in the GIT Archive
'access_biomonitoring'.  That archive describes how DEP data was accessed 
from on-line resources, using a series of Python scripts. In this archive
we use R to conduct statistical analysis. Most graphics for this data source are
maps, and were developed in ArcGIS. Shapefiles and map products are available
in the other archive.

# Contents

`CB_Invertebrate_Stations.csv`  -- List of Stream Invertebrate monitoring stations
    in the Casco Bay watershed.  This provides geospatiual information on
    sampling points.

`Biomonitoring_Samples_CB.csv` -- list of SAMPLES associated with those Stations.
    The primary data we work with here are the letter designations of water
    quality class.  Those classes are derived from a big biological
    integrity-index style classification model developed by Maine DEP.
